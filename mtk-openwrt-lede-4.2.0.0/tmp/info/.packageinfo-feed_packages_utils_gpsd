Title: An interface daemon for GPS receivers

Description:     gpsd is a userland daemon acting as a translator between GPS and AIS receivers
  and their clients. gpsd listens on port 2947 for clients requesting
  position/time/velocity information.  The receivers are expected to generate
  position information in a well-known format -- as NMEA-0183 sentences, SiRF
  binary, Rockwell binary, Garmin binary format, or other vendor binary
  protocols.  gpsd takes this information from the GPS and translates it into
  something uniform and easier to understand for clients.
  This package contains the GPS daemon.
